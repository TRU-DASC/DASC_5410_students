# DASC 5410 - Data and Database Management for Data Science
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to database systems, covering the fundamentals of data types, structures, and modeling techniques. Students will explore structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, learning to use query languages like SQL. The course emphasizes data quality, Big Data storage (Hadoop, MapReduce), and NoSQL databases, with hands-on exercises in text analysis, temporal and spatial data, and data mining. By the end of the course, students will have the skills to design, manage, and analyze databases effectively in various real-world scenarios.

## Learning objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of concepts related to data and databases  
2. Perform queries on databases and use the results in other programs and programming
languages  
3. Design a conceptual and physical model for a typical transactional database  
4. Set up a local database, import/export data, integrate data from multiple sources, and maintain data integrity  
5. Utilize different measurements for data quality, evaluate data sets for missing data, analyze outliers  
6. Prepare data for analysis by aggregation, dimensionality reduction, and discretization  
7. Identify and articulate the challenges and benefits of a specific type or set of data  
8. Describe the challenges associated with working with Big Data  
9. Manipulate and retrieve data from noSQL databases (MongoDB)  
10. Apply core data mining algorithms and be able to interpret the results.

## Assessment overview

You are responsible for the following deliverables, which will determine your course grade:

| Assignment            | Note                                       | Weight | Date            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------|

## Weekly assignments

Every week, you will have a worksheet that is worth 2%. These low-stakes assignments consist of multiple choice questions and small exercises that help you consolidate your understanding of the materials and serve as a formative assessment. 

The worksheet will be distributed via Github classroom every Monday (except for midterms' weeks) and the deadline for each worksheet is the same Sunday of that week at 11:59 PM. 

## Mid-terms & exam

There will be two midterms and one final exam in this course.

The midterms are closed-book format, and they will take place on Moodle for the duration of 45 minutes. It will consist of a mix of multiple choice, fill in the blank, and open-ended questions. 

The final exam is closed-book format, taking place on Moodle for the duration of 90 minutes. It will consist of a mix of multiple choice, fill in the blank, and open-ended questions. 

The final exam will cover all the materials in the course. 

## Attendance, late assignments, academic concessions, academic accomodation

### Attendance

A registered student who does not attend the first two events (e.g., lectures/labs/ etc.) of their course(s) and who has not made prior arrangements acceptable to the instructor(s) may, at the discretion of the instructor(s), be considered to have withdrawn from the course(s) and have their course registration(s) deleted.

Please refer to [TRU's attendance policy](https://www.tru.ca/__shared/assets/Policy_ED_03-135351.pdf). In addition, we will take attendance during class via Moodle's QR code.

In the CS department, you need to get **at least 75% attendance** for passing any course. 

### Academic concessions
If you encounter situations that may impede your ability to meet course requirements—such as illness, family emergencies, or other significant life events—please notify the instructor **at least 24 hours before deadline**. Academic concessions, including extensions or alternative assessments, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You may be required to provide documentation to support your request. Concession requests after the deadline has passed will likely be refused. 

### Late Assignments
Assignments are expected to be submitted on time. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 25% per day, up to a maximum of 75%. After 3 days, late assignments will no longer be accepted and will receive a grade of zero. Extensions may be granted in exceptional circumstances, provided that you contact the instructor before the deadline.

### Accessbility
Students registered with the Accessibility Services who require accommodations must provide their Letter of Accommodation to the instructor as soon as possible. This letter will outline the necessary accommodations to ensure an equitable learning environment. Please ensure that this is done early in the term to facilitate timely arrangements.

## Policy on the use of generative AI

Please refer to TRU's guideline on the use of generative AI tools such as chatGPT or Copilot in this course.
